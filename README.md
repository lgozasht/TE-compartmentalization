# TE-compartmentalization

This repository contains the code associated with Gozashti and Corbett-Detig's **Universal signatures of transposable element compartmentalization across eukaryotic genes**. 

## TE-compartmentalization pipeline

We define "TE-compartmentalized genes" as genes whose flanking regions show TE density within the top 90th percentile when all genes are compared for a given species. This pipeline can be divided into three
